# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) example

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of examining and analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics and gain insights into the data. It involves using statistical and visualization techniques to understand the distribution of the data, identify patterns and trends, detect outliers and anomalies, and formulate hypotheses for further analysis.

Through this Exploratory Data Analysis we will understand, explore, and visualize the *CRIME INCIDENT REPORTS* datasets to extract insights and inform decision-making.

Disclaimer : The goal here is to provide overall data-driven insights but depending on the question asked it is possible to have a way more specific approach, orient the analysis and use other technical skills.
